**** BEHAVIOURAL PATTERN ****

1. Encapsulates State Behavior: 
Allows an object to change its behavior dynamically based on its internal state.

2. Promotes Maintainability: 
Moves state-specific logic into separate classes, reducing complexity in the main object.

3. Real-World Use Cases: 
Used in vending machines, traffic lights, and authentication workflows.
