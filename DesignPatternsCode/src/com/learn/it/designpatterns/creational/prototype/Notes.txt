**** CREATIONAL PATTERN ****

1. Creates Objects by Cloning: 
Instead of creating new instances, objects are copied from an existing prototype.

2. Reduces Costly Instantiations: 
Useful when object creation is expensive, such as in game development or complex configurations.

3. Real-World Use Cases: 
Used in document templates, game object cloning, and deep copy implementations in serialization.
