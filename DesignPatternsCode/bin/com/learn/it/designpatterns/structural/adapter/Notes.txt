1. Bridges Incompatible Interfaces: 
Converts an existing classâ€™s interface into one that a client expects, enabling interoperability.

2. Supports Legacy Code Integration: 
Allows old systems to work with new ones without modifying existing code.

3. Real-World Use Cases: 
Used in converting data formats, integrating third-party libraries, and enabling cross-platform compatibility (e.g., power adapters, API wrappers).
