**** BEHAVIOURAL PATTERN ****

1. Encapsulates Algorithms: 
Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates them in separate classes, and makes them interchangeable at runtime.

2. Promotes Flexibility: 
Allows selecting the desired behavior dynamically without modifying the client code.

3. Real-World Use Cases: 
Used in payment processing systems, sorting algorithms, and authentication mechanisms.
