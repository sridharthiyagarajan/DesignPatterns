**** CREATIONAL PATTERN ****

1. Step-by-Step Object Construction: 
Separates object creation from its representation, allowing complex objects to be built in a structured manner.

2. Improves Readability & Maintainability: 
Avoids telescoping constructors by providing a fluent API for setting attributes.

3. Real-World Use Cases: 
Used in constructing JSON/XML parsers, creating complex UI components, and assembling immutable objects like StringBuilder in Java.
