1. Ensures a Single Instance: 
Restricts a class to have only one instance and provides a global access point.

2. Lazy or Eager Initialization: 
Can be instantiated on demand (lazy) or at startup (eager), depending on use case requirements.

3. Real-World Use Cases: 
Used in logging, database connections, and configuration management.
