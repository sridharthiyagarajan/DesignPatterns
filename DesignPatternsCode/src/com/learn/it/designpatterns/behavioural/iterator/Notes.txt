**** BEHAVIOURAL PATTERN ****

1. Sequential Access: 
Provides a way to traverse elements in a collection without exposing its underlying structure.

2. Decouples Collection & Iteration Logic: 
The iterator handles traversal, allowing different iteration strategies without modifying the collection.

3. Real-World Use Cases: 
Used in data structures like lists, trees, and databases to enable uniform iteration.
