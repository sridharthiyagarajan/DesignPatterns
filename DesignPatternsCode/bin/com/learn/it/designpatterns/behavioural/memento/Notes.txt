**** BEHAVIOURAL PATTERN ****

1. Preserves Object State: 
Captures and stores an object's internal state without exposing its details, allowing restoration later.

2. Encapsulated Snapshot: 
Uses a "Memento" object to save state, while the "Originator" creates and restores it, keeping implementation hidden.

3. Supports Undo/Redo: 
Commonly used in applications requiring rollback functionality, such as text editors and transactional systems.
